// Every download the renderer starts, written somewhere safe first.
//
// The renderer is sandboxed, so anything it hands the user — an export, a
// converted document, a QR image — leaves through an `<a download>` and lands
// in Chromium's download pipeline (see src/lib/saveFile.ts). Left to itself
// that pipeline picks the destination folder AND writes into it while the
// download is still in progress, which is how a half-written file with a name
// nobody chose ends up sitting next to the user's PDF.
//
// So the file is staged in this app's own AppData folder and only moved to the
// destination once it is whole. The destination folder sees one atomic arrival
// and nothing else — no partial file, no leftover if the write fails halfway.
//
// ⚠️ `setSavePath` has to be called SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `will-download`.
// Miss that turn of the loop and Chromium falls back to its own routine —
// which raises a save dialog of its own and writes straight into whatever
// folder it lands on, i.e. exactly the behaviour this file exists to prevent.
// That is why the staging path is set first and the user is asked afterwards.
