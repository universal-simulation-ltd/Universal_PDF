/**
 * Undo, across BOTH histories — the annotation layer's, and the document's.
 *
 * ⚠️ Why there are two, and why this is the only place that knows it (James,
 * 2026-09-08: "allow the undo option to undo things like merge too"). Ctrl+Z
 * has always walked `annotationStore.past`, a list of annotation arrays for one
 * set of bytes. Merge, convert, a page delete and a metadata scrub replace the
 * bytes, and clear that history on the way through — deliberately, so a stroke
 * drawn on the old document cannot be undone back onto the new one. The effect
 * was that the largest changes in the app were the only ones nothing could take
 * back.
 *
 * ORDER: annotations first, document second. That is not a preference, it is
 * the only order that can be right — a document-level change empties the
 * annotation history, so anything left in it was drawn AFTER the last document
 * change and must come off first. Undo therefore walks back through this
 * session's strokes, and only then puts the pre-merge document back.
 *
 * Redo is annotations-only and stays that way: the document stack holds bytes,
 * and keeping a forward copy as well would double the memory for the rarer half
 * of a feature nobody has asked for.
