// Actions ▸ Advanced ▸ Advanced export — the things that change what the
// exported file IS, rather than how big it is: flatten, strip metadata, lock.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THEY SHARE A DIALOG rather than being rows in the Advanced menu
// (owner decision, 2026-09-01). They are routinely wanted TOGETHER: the
// document you flatten so nobody can edit what you signed is the same document
// you then want sealed with a password, and stripped of the author's name.
// Separate actions would mean flatten, download, re-open the result, lock,
// download again — two files on disk and a version number burnt on the
// intermediate one. Here they are applied in one pass to one file.
//
// ⚠️ ORDER MATTERS AND IS NOT NEGOTIABLE: flatten, then scrub, then encrypt.
// The rasteriser writes a fresh document carrying its own producer metadata,
// so scrubbing before it would be undone; pdf-lib cannot open an encrypted
// document at all, so both must happen before the lock.
//
// ⚠️ TWO ORTHOGONAL QUESTIONS, and until 2026-08-31 the export dialog asked
// them as one. `CompressQuality` is a single scale — light / balanced / strong
// — but 'light' differs from the other two in KIND, not in degree: it is a
// lossless re-save, while both the others turn every page into a picture.
// Presenting them as one row of three made "do I keep my text layer?" look
// like a compression setting, and gated it behind whether flattening would
// save enough bytes to be worth offering.
//
// It is not a size question. The reason to want a flattened PDF is "nobody can
// reflow, copy or edit what I signed", which is true of a 40 KB letter exactly
// as it is of a 40 MB scan — and a 40 KB letter never cleared the ≥20% AND
// ≥100 KB bar in `worthOffering`, so on every text document (every Word file
// this app converts, for one) the mode was present, functional and completely
// unreachable.
//
// So the two questions are two controls: a FLATTEN checkbox, always available,
// and — only once flattening is on — a strength choice between the two
// rasterising levels. 'light' is no longer a button; it IS the unchecked box.
