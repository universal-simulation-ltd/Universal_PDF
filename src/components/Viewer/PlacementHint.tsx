// The banner that says a placement is ARMED and waiting for a tap.
//
// ⚠️ Why this exists (owner, 2026-08-30: "you need an indicator to show that you
// need to tap to place the signature / name / date, or QR code for example,
// otherwise you're not sure what to do"). Saving a signature, or hitting "Add to
// page" in the QR dialog, closes the dialog and leaves the app in a state with
// no visible difference from the one before it: a tool is armed and the very
// next tap on the page drops something. The only feedback was the cursor-
// following ghost in AnnotationLayer — which needs a HOVER, so on a phone there
// was no feedback at all, and even on desktop only the signature had one (an
// armed QR / picture had none on any device).
//
// It is deliberately not a toast: it must stay up for exactly as long as the
// state it describes, and go the instant the thing lands. Nothing is timed.
//
// ⚠️ It sits in the MIDDLE of the document area, not under the toolbar (James,
// 2026-09-05: "the tooltip that appears at the top for signature placement etc
// needs to be more prominent - maybe in the centre of the screen, with a don't
// show again option"). A pill tucked against the top edge is exactly where a
// browser puts its own chrome, and it was being read as decoration by the
// people it was written for. Covering the page is affordable *because* the
// thing it announces ends the moment the page is tapped — the card is never up
// for longer than one gesture — and the whole overlay stays
// `pointer-events-none` but for its buttons, so that gesture still lands.
