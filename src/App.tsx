              The outer columns are both `1fr`, which is what centres the tools:
              column 3's content (Sign, Export, Actions, the profile pill and the
              changelog icon) sets its width, and the equal `1fr` on column 1
              mirrors that width as empty space. */}

                cluster moves to the bottom bar, leaving this end of the row
                empty — so on a phone the app's own name was nowhere on screen
                while a document was open. On lg+ the tools own the middle column
                and this one is the empty counterweight, hence lg:hidden.

                ⚠️ Deliberately NOT a link or a button. The comment above is
                explicit that this bar has no home control: leaving a document
                is Actions → File → Close PDF, one way out, and a second one
                hiding behind the logo is exactly what was removed. It is a
                label.

                The mark's own tile is #0f172a, which is bg-slate-900 — so it
                disappears into the bar and what reads is the white page and
                the orange fold, not a square sitting on a square. */}

                ⚠️ They must stay IN THE FLOW. They were once a second copy,
                absolutely positioned against the bar's right edge, while the row
                itself was centred at the document's width — and the two collided
                whenever the window was about as wide as the document (~1280px, a
                maximised window on a 13" screen): the pinned cluster painted
                straight over Actions and over the open Actions menu. As a grid
                cell they cannot overlap anything, and the width they take is
                also what sizes the empty column that centres the tools. */}

              {/* Export STARTS ON THE DOCUMENT'S RIGHT EDGE — it sits in the
                  grey strip beside the page rather than inside it (owner,
                  2026-08-29: a box drawn on the empty bar right of Export,
                  "just to the right of the alignment with the pdf edge").

                  It ENDED on that edge from 2026-08-25 until then, and before
                  that it floated in the middle of whatever the centred tools
                  left over. Same line, other side of it.

                  The anchor is still a sized box rather than any positioning of
                  Export: this strip is the page's right margin, so its LEFT
                  edge is the page's right edge at every zoom. Export leads the
                  strip; `ml-auto` on the profile cluster keeps that pinned to
                  the window's right where it has always been, and `pl-2` is the
                  "just to the right" — flush against the edge reads as a
                  misalignment rather than a decision.

                  ⚠️ `min-w-max` is the collision guard, and it is why this can
                  be anchored at all — the previous version refused to anchor
                  because a page as wide as the window would drive Export into
                  the profile pill. It cannot: the box never gets narrower than
                  the controls inside it, so once the margin runs out the box
                  stops shrinking and the `flex-1` spacer gives up its space
                  instead. Nothing overlaps; Export just stops moving right.
                  ⚠️ Export is INSIDE the box now, so it is inside that guard —
                  keep it there.

                  ⚠️ This cell must stay STRETCHED (no `justify-self`) — it
                  spans the whole right-hand `1fr`, which is also what keeps the
                  tool cluster on the window's centre line. */}
