// Where the desktop app's Save dialog opens.
//
//   ./scripts/preview.sh             # in one terminal (Universal PDF is :5174)
//   npm run test:save-folder:desktop # in another
//
// ⚠️ The complaint this exists to answer: a PDF opened from a folder on the
// machine offered to save back into ~/Downloads, so every edited document had
// to be dragged home by hand. The dialog should open where the document came
// from.
//
// ⚠️ And the trap underneath it, which is the reason for the third check. A PDF
// handed over by the OS is read in the MAIN process and reaches the page as
// bytes, which the page turns into a synthetic `File`. That File has no path —
// so a bridge that reported "this file has no folder" as "forget the folder"
// would erase, one beat later, the very answer the main process had just been
// handed. The dialog would then open in ~/Downloads for the one case the
// feature exists for: double-clicking a PDF in Explorer or Finder.
//
// The OS dialog itself is never shown here. `dialog.showSaveDialog` is replaced
// in the main process with a recorder, which is where the claim actually lives:
// what matters is the `defaultPath` we hand Electron, not what the OS then
// draws with it.
